## 🛠️ Formatters

These are the external formatters I use to keep code clean and consistent:

- 🅿️ **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** – Default formatter (supports most languages)
- ⚫️ **[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** – Used specifically for Python formatting

## 🎨 Theme

I'm using a modified porting of the [EyeHealth](https://github.com/jonathanhild/eyehealth) theme.
